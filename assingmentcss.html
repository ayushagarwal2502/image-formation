    The stars of the Fossils gallery include Stan the T. rex,
     a giant Plesiosaur and a massive fossil tree. The gallery
      takes you on a tour of life on Earth over the last 600 million 
      years, from the earliest evidence of bacteria to swamp forests and 
      enormous sea reptiles. Stunning rocks and crystals in the Minerals 
      gallery give a glimpse of the treasures found in the Earth.
       The Meteorite display includes pieces of meteorite from Mars 
       and the Moon which you can actually touch.</p>
